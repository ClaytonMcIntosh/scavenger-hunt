# Scavenger Hunt

Scavenger Hunt is my final project for coding boot camp 2022. It's a MERN full stack application wish means it uses React for the front end, MongoDB for databases, and Express and Node.js for the server application layer.

The idea is that someone who is resoponsible for others, be that a teacher, parent or manager, has a fun way to entertain in the space they are in. All they need to do is make sure everyone has a device, and then they can run a scavenger hunt. At home parents can get their kids to collect items, in an office, a manager could get their team to have a bit of fun as a warm up before an importaint meeting. This activity is simple, get's people on their feet for a short amount of time and can be a friendly competition. 

## Elevator pitch

Scavenger Hunt helps you create and record real world search and find games to play with kids, in the office or on a larger scale in your community.
